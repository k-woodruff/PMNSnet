# PMNSnet
PyTorch implementation of ~SciNet~
https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.010508

*To do:*
* Fix loss function
  * Currently uses mean-squared error loss
  * Description of loss fcn to constrain latent variables to be independent is in supplementary materials
* Generate input data
  * Input data is currently randomly generated
* Load in pretrained model
* Add Tensorboard or other evaluation stuff
  * Want to monitor loss, accuracy and latent variables, at least
